  <p>
    I was a Wildlife Ecology major working on becoming a wildlife biologist at
    the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, but my senior year I made
    a huge transition to Computer Science.
    <br />
    Now I'm a full-stack software developer and consultant, who loves
    understanding and building complex systems.
