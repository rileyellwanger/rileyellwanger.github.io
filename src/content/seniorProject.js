    My final year at UNL I worked on a team with 5 other graduating seniors on a supporting sponsor's project. 
    Our sponsor was the Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory, a beef cattle production research ranch in the Sandhills 
    of Nebraska, and they needed to migrate their data to a database, and a web app to manage it, to better store, 
    organize, and access their research data for analysis. During this project my team and I worked in an Agile 
    framework with weekly sponsor meetings, and regular releases to gather and prioritize requirements of the 
    project from the sponsor, build a story map, choose an infrastructure and tech stack, and finally implement 
    the solution. I loved working with the sponsors and my team to understand their needs and requirements, 
    and design and build a system to meet those needs.
