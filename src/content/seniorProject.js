    My final year at UNL I got to work on a team with 5 other graduating seniors on a supporting sponsor's project. 
    Our sponsor was the Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory, a beef cattle production research facility in western 
    Nebraska, and they needed a database management web app to better store, organize, and access their research 
    data. During this project my team and I worked in an Agile framework to gather and prioritize requirements of 
    the project from the sponsor, build a story map, choose an infrastructure and tech stack, and implement the 
    solution with weekly sponsor meetings, and regular releases. I loved working with the sponsors and my team to 
    understand their needs and requirements, and design and build a system to meet those needs.
