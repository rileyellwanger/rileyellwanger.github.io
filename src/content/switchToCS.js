const switchToCS = <p>Jumping into the Computer Science program with no programming experience and only a vague knowledge 
    of computers was a leap of faith where I bet on myself. I've received plenty of strange looks
    when I tell someone I switched my major from Wildlife Ecology to Computer Science right before 
    what was supposed to be my senior year. There were plenty of late nights in the library searching for 
    nasty bugs in assignments and studying core concepts, but I'm so glad I did it.
