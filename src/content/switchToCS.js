const switchToCS = <p>I took a leap of faith into the Computer Science program with no programming 
    experience, and only what I knew about computers from using them, but I bet on myself. I get
    some great reactions when I tell someone I switched my major from Wildlife Ecology to Computer Science 
    right before what was supposed to be my senior year. That added another two years before I graduate 
    with a bachelors, but I was planning on going to grad school for Wildlife Ecology. I figured 
    I'd have more career opportunities with Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science than a Master's degree 
    in Wildlife Ecology, so I went for it. I also want to use my software development skills to contribute 
    to conservation. There were plenty of late nights in the library searching for bugs in assignments and 
    studying core concepts, but it's been worth it. I've gotten to meet great, smart people and work on some 
    cool projects.
