    After a year and half I got an internship at a trucking company in Lincoln, Crete Carrier Corporation, 
    where I've had such a great experience, and got a ton of hands on learning developing full-stack internal 
    web apps to keep the trucks moving. I worked on rewriting legacy web applications in a new tech stack, 
    maintaining some legacy apps, and building APIs to integrate into the existing bidding process to speed 
    it up, and be more competitive.
