    After a year and half I got an internship at Crete Carrier Corporation, a trucking company in Lincoln, 
    got a ton of experience developing full-stack internal web apps to keep the trucks moving. I worked on 
    rewriting legacy web applications in a new tech stack, maintaining some legacy apps, and building new APIs 
    to integrate into the existing bidding process to speed it up, and be more competitive. I love working on 
    the full stack to design a complete systems and see a project from requirements to production.
