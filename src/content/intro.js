const intro = <p>I grew up in Nebraska, where it's all about the Cornhuskers. So going to the university 
    in Lincoln (for football games, and for school) was always a dream. I received the Regent's Scholarship, 
    and originally majored in Wildlife Ecology to be a Wildlife Biologist because of my love for the outdoors. 
    I've been hunting and fishing my entire life, and wanted to pursue a career managing wildlife and natural 
    resources to conserve, so future generations can enjoy the same opportunities I have. 
    <br/>
    I decided to jump to the evergrowing industry of software for the endles opportunities 
    where I can creatively solve problems, be challenged continuously, and just build cool stuff! I hope to 
    contribute to conservation with my software development skills in the future.
