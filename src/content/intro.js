const intro = <p>I grew up in Nebraska where it's all about the Cornhuskers. So going to the university 
    (for football games, and for school) was always a dream. I received the Regent's Scholarship and 
    originally majored in Wildlife Ecology because of my love for the outdoors. I've been  
    hunting and fishing my entire life, and wanted to pursue a career conserving wildlife and natural 
    resources so future generations can enjoy the same opportunities I have. 
    <br/>
    I made the jump to this evergrowing industry of software for the endless possibilities of opportunities 
    where I will be challenged continuously, creatively solve problems, and just build cool stuff! I hope to 
    contribute to conservation with my software development skills in the future.
