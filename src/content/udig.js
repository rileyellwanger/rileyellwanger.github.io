    After starting on my senior project I began looking for a job where I could wear multiple hats; work with 
    users, be involved in the design process, work full-stack, improve my development skills, and learn more 
    about system design and business. This lead me to consulting, and I've found a company that's a great fit: 
    UDIG, a consulting company in Richmond, Virginia. My family and I are very excited about the big move from 
    Nebraska to Virginia, and I'm looking forward to beginning my career, meeting great new people, exploring a 
    new city and state, and building some awesome software.
