const welcome = <p>Welcome to my personal website and portfolio, and thanks for stopping by.
    Here you'll find info about myself, and my software development experience. <br/>
    I created this page as a living resume where I can share my professional experience, 
    as well as personal interests. <br/>
    This is a work in progress, and I'll be updating as often as I can. Feel free to reach 
    out with feedback.
